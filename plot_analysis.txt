1. How did you handle Twitter's rate limiting, and what are some options for improving this in the next iteration of this project?
   - I never reached the limit of allowed requests which is 1500 requests per 15 minutes for the user timeline endpoint. To optimize the number of requests I am requesting 200 tweets per request (max amount) as well as I am checking if I reached the end of the timeline.
   
2. How extendible is the software you wrote? How would you make it more reusable?
   - Make the Twitter hooks configurable. For example allow any Twitter account to be used in the analysis.

3. What's the most flawed piece of the analysis, and how would you improve it if you had
   more time?
   - I am analyzing Twitter activity looking at time of day (i.e. 1pm). The analysis would be more complete if I record day of week (i.e. Monday) as well.

4. What would it take to make this a production system used everyday by our marketing team?
   - Automate the process of creating the plots from the API calls.
